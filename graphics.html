        <p class="desc-title">Clients</p> 
        <p>Individual Writing Groups</p>
        
        <p class="desc-title">Goals</p>
        <p>These project pieces were to create visually appealing graphics for writing groups that would attract people to join, capturing the group's aesthetics and genres. Graphics ranged from creating useable templates for advertisements, to member acceptance posts and admin post headers. The project helped me improve my skills in Photoshop and creativity, and these pieces were successful in creating visually appealing graphics that met the client's needs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create Graphics for Advertisement.</li>
            <li>Establish a Visual Aesthetic.</li>
            <li>Make Easily Accessible and Navigatable Resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Process</p>
        <p>The design process involved a lot of research and analysis of other graphics to draw inspiration from. The templates and drafts were created using Photoshop and sometimes Pinterest boards were used to determine the vibe that resonated with what the admins envisioned for the visual aesthetics. The graphic styles that the client wanted were also considered during the design process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand Client's Vision.</li>
            <li>Produce Multiple Templates.</li>
            <li>Coordinate Templates and Aesthetics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Takeaways</p>
        <p>The project helped me improve my skills in using Adobe Photoshop, organizing multiple templates for PSD files, applying filters for coloring, and searching for free resources to use. It encouraged me to explore locaaing resources that admins would be able to utilize as well if they didn't have the same tools I had. It also helped me upgrade my creativity skills and understand how to execute a client's visual wants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Balancing Creative Control.</li>
            <li>Expansion on Design Research.</li>
            <li>Learning New Application Skills.</li>
        </ul>
