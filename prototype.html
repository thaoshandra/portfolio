        <p class="desc-title">Goals</p>
        <p>Our group was tasked with creating a new graphical/visual interface for a business, and we chose to create a mobile ordering pizza app that focused on custom pizza orders. We conducted a survey and used user testing with specific target users to refine the prototype and create an interface design that met customer needs and provided the best user experience possible. We learned that creating prototypes, gathering data, analyzing data, updating the prototype based on collected data, and choosing a way to implement it are all critical steps in creating an effective interface. The project was a valuable learning experience that provided insights into the complexities involved in creating an effective user interface.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create Mobile Application Interface Design.</li>
            <li>Collect and Analyze Data.</li>
            <li>Write Comphrensive Reports.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Process</p>
        <p>We conducted a survey to collect data on people's experiences with ordering pizza and their concerns about mobile apps. We then created the first prototype of the app's most used screens, conducted user testing, and adjusted the prototype based on the data. In the next iteration, we used specific target users to provide valuable feedback on the UI/UX, artistic and graphic concepts, and accessibility concerns. The third prototype was adjusted based on extensive feedback before we began creating the interface.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prototype Iterations.</li>
            <li>Strategic User Testing.</li>
            <li>Coding and Framework Research.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Takeaways</p>
        <p>The project taught me the amount of work required to create and develop prototypes before implementing the actual interfaces with coding. We had to consider various aspects even when we started coding to implement the interface, such as switching platforms or languages. We were also aware that there would be many more iterations of data collection, analyzation, and testing to continue building the design to its best form had this been a project outside of a one semester course.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Splitting and Balancing Tasks.</li>
            <li>Research and Data Gathering.</li>
            <li>Interface Design Concepts.</li>
        </ul>
