        <p class="desc-title">Project Summary</p>
        <p>For this project, I created a new website from scratch for a local tailor. The goal was to establish an online presence that would allow potential customers to learn about the business's services, contact information, and basic information about the head tailor. Given the business's specialty in wedding dresses, I coordinated the colors and established an aesthetic that would be visually appealing and aligned with the tailor's brand. Through this project, I aimed to solve the problem of the business's lack of online presence and to provide potential customers with the basic information they needed to consider the tailor as a viable option for their needs.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Process</p>
        <p>The design process involved figuring out how to break down the information that would be provided on the website and how much of it was necessary. I aimed for a minimalist approach that would provide users with all the most basic and necessary details. Different visual images were experimented with to determine which ones worked best with the chosen color scheme. Several different formats were tried before the final look was chosen.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Solution</p>
        <p>The final design fulfilled the objective of providing customers with crucial details about the company, its services, and its head tailor with over 30 years of experience in the industry. A key focus was to highlight the specialty in wedding dresses and formal wear, along with reassuring potential customers about the quality and service that the small local shop could provide.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Results</p>
        <p>The website was launched successfully and provided customers with all the necessary information they needed. The project taught me the importance of considering every aspect of a website, including interface design, visual concepts, and text content. It was also a reminder of how much time and effort is required to pull everything together into a cohesive and effective website.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the project to create a new website for the small local tailor shop was a success. By coordinating colors and establishing the desired aesthetic and ambience, the site was able to focus on the shop's specialty in wedding dresses, while providing potential customers with all the basic information they needed to know. Throughout the design process, a significant amount of time and effort was put into breaking down the information and finding visuals that worked with the color scheme, resulting in a minimal yet effective design.</p>
        
        <p>This project provided valuable lessons in the challenges of designing a website alone, including the need to work on all aspects of the project, from the interface to the design concepts and visuals, to the text content that must go on the pages. Overall, the project was a great learning experience and allowed me to showcase my skills in creating an effective and visually appealing website.</p>
