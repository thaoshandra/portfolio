        <h2>I am a first-generation Hmong American graduate from Metropolitan State University with a degree in Computer Information Technology.</h2>
        <p>I’m excited to bring my career and apply my knowledge and skills to create innovative and user-friendly designs.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a passion for expanding my knowledge of design, which drives me to create designs that solve complex problems and improve user experiences. I’ve gained hands-on experience in Adobe Creative Suite, Visual Studio Code, various programming languages, Microsoft 365, and other free tools online made available to all that demonstrate my skills and expertise.</p>
        <p>I’m eager to collaborate with industry professionals and learn from their experiences to enhance my skills and knowledge. I believe that the key to success is to remain curious, flexible, and adaptable in a constantly evolving field.</p>
