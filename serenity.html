        <p>Serenity Tailoring</p>
        
        <p class="desc-title">Goals</p>
        <p>The project involved creating a new website for a local tailor specializing in wedding dresses, with the goal of establishing an online presence and providing potential customers with necessary information about the business and services. Colors and aesthetics were coordinated to align with the tailor's brand. The project aimed to solve the problem of the business's lack of online presence.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Establish Online Presence.</li>
            <li>Wedding Dress Emphasis.</li>
            <li>Guarantee Quality Services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Process</p>
        <p>The design process involved figuring out how to break down the information that would be provided on the website and how much of it was necessary. I aimed for a minimalist approach that would provide users with all the most basic and necessary details. Different visual images were experimented with to determine which ones worked best with the chosen color scheme. Several different formats were tried before the final look was chosen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimalist Style.</li>
            <li>Template and Format Iterations.</li>
            <li>Content Editing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Takeaways</p>
        <p>The project taught me the importance of considering every aspect of a website, including interface design, visual concepts, and text content. It was also a reminder of how much time and effort is required to pull everything together into a cohesive and effective website when working alone.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time Management.</li>
            <li>Client Communication.</li>
            <li>Resourcing and Research.</li>
        </ul>
