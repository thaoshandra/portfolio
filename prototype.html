        <p>Human Computer Experience</p>
        
        <p class="desc-title">Project Summary</p>
        <p>The task was to create a new graphical/visual interface (mobile or website) for a business. Our group decided to create a mobile ordering pizza app with a focus on recreating the functions for creating a custom pizza order.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Process</p>
        <p>We conducted a survey to collect data on people's experiences with ordering pizza and their concerns about mobile apps. We then created the first prototype of the app's most used screens, conducted user testing, and adjusted the prototype based on the data. In the next iteration, we used specific target users to provide valuable feedback on the UI/UX, artistic and graphic concepts, and accessibility concerns. The third prototype was adjusted based on extensive feedback before we began creating the interface.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Solution</p>
        <p>Through all the testing, feedback, and analyzation, we received very good data that aided in the direction of our prototype updates. Our professor highly approved our tactic of utilizing user testing with specific target users for valuable feedback.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Results</p>
        <p>The project taught us the amount of work required to create and develop prototypes before implementing the actual interfaces with coding. We had to consider various aspects even when we started coding to implement the interface, such as switching platforms or languages. We were aware that there would be many more iterations of data collection, analyzation, and testing to continue building the design to its best form had this been a project outside of a one semester course.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p>Based on the process we went through in creating a new graphical/visual interface for a mobile ordering pizza app, it is clear that designing an interface involves a lot of work and effort. We learned that creating prototypes, gathering data, analyzing data, updating the prototype based on collected data, and choosing a way to implement it are all critical steps in creating an effective interface.</p>
        <p>Through the iterative process, we were able to refine the prototype, with feedback from different target users to create an interface design that met their needs and provided the best user experience possible. We found that user testing with specific target users was highly valuable in guiding our design decisions, and our professor highly approved of this approach.</p>
        <p>Although we only began implementing the coding aspect and the app was not fully created, this project taught us that there are always many aspects to consider when creating an interface. We would have needed many more iterations of data collection, analysis, and testing to continue building the design to its best form had this been a full project. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into the complexities involved in creating an effective user interface.</p>
