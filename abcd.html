        <p class="desc-title">Goals</p>
        <p>For a senior capstone project at university, the objective was to redesign a non-profit organization's website to make it more visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly. The team worked with HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, and utilized an agile/scrum environment to complete a certain number of tasks each week. The design solution included bold and vibrant colors that matched the organization's culture, and login functions were successfully implemented for admins. The majority of the pages were updated to maintain consistency throughout the website. The final result was pleasing to the professor, and the project involved an entire semester of work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Redesign Visual Interface.</li>
            <li>Establish Color Scheme.</li>
            <li>Implment User Restrictions.</li>
            <li>Focus on Responsiveness.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Process</p>
        <p>We worked in an agile/scrum environment and conducted extensive research to understand the concepts of CSS. We used HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL on Visual Studio Code, as well as other applications like Filezilla and Github. We completed a certain number of tasks every week and expanded on them if needed based on our professor's instructions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual Studio Code.</li>
            <li>Reorganize Code Files.</li>
            <li>Focus on Client Needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="desc-title">Takeaways</p>
        <p>Although there were a few pieces that remained incomplete, our professor was pleased with the end result after an entire semester of work. This project taught me how to successfully implement login functions for admins, details of code organization and detail to project scope, and how to work in an agile/scrum environment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Code Organization and Detail.</li>
            <li>Backend Coding.</li>
            <li>Exposure to Frameworks and Resources.</li>
        </ul>
