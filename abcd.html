        <p class="desc-title">Project Summary</p>
        <p>For our senior capstone project at university, my partner and I were tasked with redesigning a non-profit organization's website that was previously built by other students. The focus was to make the interface more appealing, responsive and user-friendly for both admins and non-admins.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Process</p>
        <p>We worked in an agile/scrum environment and conducted extensive research to understand the concepts of CSS. We used HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL on Visual Studio Code, as well as other applications like Filezilla and Github. We completed a certain number of tasks every week and expanded on them if needed based on our professor's instructions.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Solution</p>
        <p>We chose the colors of the Indian flag to match the organization's location and culture. We wanted a modern and sleek look but with bold and vibrant colors to fit the site's artistic aesthetic. We created multiple designs and iterations to ensure the site was visually appealing and cohesive. This allowed future groups to have options to work off of while keeping the site's aesthetic.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Results</p>
        <p>Although there were a few pieces that remained incomplete, our professor was pleased with the end result after an entire semester of work. We successfully implemented login functions for admins, so only they could access specific pages, while non-admins could access basic pages. Additionally, we updated the design of the majority of the pages to maintain consistency throughout the website.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p>Our senior capstone project involved redesigning a non-profit organization's website to make it more appealing and user-friendly. We utilized agile/scrum methods, and our design solution was based on bold and vibrant colors matching the organization's culture. We successfully implemented login functions and updated the majority of the pages, keeping the website cohesive.</p>
