        <p class="desc-title">Project Summary</p>
        <p>The project involved creating logos for four different clients, including a tailoring business, two YouTube channels, and a pop-up tarot shop on Etsy. The approach was to analyze the level of professionalism, brand, and presence the clients wanted to establish and collect any requirements or ideas before starting a design.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Process</p>
        <p>Most of the clients were clear about the aesthetic or vibe they wanted to establish. Multiple design ideas were drafted up for each client, and consideration was put into typography, sizing, coloring, researching fonts, and examining other logos to see what looked good and what didn't. Various design apps from Photoshop to Procreate were used to create logo prototypes.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Solution</p>
        <p>All of the logos went through multiple iterations, with some clients having more than one person making a decision on the final design. The Serenity Tailoring logo incorporated a clever way of incorporating a sewing needle and thread, which the business owner was very pleased with. The Opinion Podcast logo had to make a statement while still being minimalistic and simple. The Shawn Stans Kpop logo was more animated, with a drawing representing the client and the channel's name present in the logo. The Sunstrology logo was aesthetically pleasing and minimalistic, with colors associated with the client's brand.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Results</p>
        <p>The project taught me the value of time left in-between designs to produce something of higher quality when revisited. Having space to analyze and come back to a design after some time was like a refresh on the lens to see what made sense, what worked, and what could be adjusted or changed.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the project involved creating logos for different clients, and the approach was to analyze the level of professionalism, brand, and presence the clients wanted to establish. The design process involved drafting up multiple ideas, with various design considerations, and using different design apps to create prototypes. The final designs went through multiple iterations, and the project taught me the importance of having time left in-between designs to produce a higher quality result.</p>
