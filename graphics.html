        <p>Individual Writing Groups</p>
        
        <p class="desc-title">Project Summary</p>
        <p>The project was to create visually appealing graphics for a writing group that would attract people to join. The graphics needed to capture the aesthetics and genres of the writing group.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Process</p>
        <p>The design process involved a lot of research and analysis of other graphics to draw inspiration from. The templates and drafts were created using Photoshop and sometimes Pinterest boards were used to determine the vibe that resonated with the entire writing group. The style that the client wanted was also considered during the design process.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Design Solution</p>
        <p>Multiple iterations and alterations were done until the final designs were approved by the admins of the groups. Headers and banners were also created to match the advertisement graphics to ensure a good visual environment for the online writing community.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Results</p>
        <p>The project helped me improve my skills in using Photoshop, organizing multiple templates for PSD files, applying filters for coloring, and searching for free resources to use. It also helped me upgrade my creativity skills and understand how to execute a client's visual wants.</p>

        <p class="desc-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p>Overall, the project was a success in creating visually appealing graphics for the writing group that captured the group's aesthetics and genres. My skills were improved, and I learned the importance of establishing a good visual environment for online communities.</p>
